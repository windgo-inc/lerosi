Low Energy Reconstruction of Source Information
-----------------------------------------------

This project is a machine vision module intended for use in low power environments
and places an emphasis on computational efficiency and accuracy. LERoSI favors
a hexagonal sampling lattice in pursuit of the above objectives, and seeks to
provide efficient resampling, homography, and information retrieval techniques
in an easy to use and understand interface.

The lerosi/iio_core module is functionally complete, with full coverage in
test/test_all.

To run the tests, use nimble tests.

This project is under heavy development, guided by the needs of a machine vision
project. It is still in an early stage of development. If you are interested
check back every week or so. The documentation is forthcoming.

Right now, the major priorities:
 - GUI for demo visualization purposes (possibly use nimx or wx)
 - High level [YOLO](https://mratsim.github.io/Arraymancer/uth.speed.html)
   samplers that work like map_inline. but produce a differently shaped output
   based on the described lattice of the sampler. This can be made to work with
   the CL or Cuda backends of arraymancer whenever the API for all that is
   stable in master.
 - DFFT
 - Scale invariants, maybe as a sampler?
 - Video and audio backends
 - Internal lab applications
