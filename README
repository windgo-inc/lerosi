Low Energy Reconstruction of Source Information
-----------------------------------------------

This project is a machine vision module intended for use in low power environments
and places an emphasis on computational efficiency and accuracy. LERoSI favors
a hexagonal sampling lattice in pursuit of the above objectives, and seeks to
provide efficient resampling, homography, and information retrieval techniques
in an easy to use and understand interface.
