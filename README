nimbones
--------

A skeleton project tree used internally for starting new nim modules quickly. This comes with an infrastructure already set up for performing pre-installation hooks, testing, and benchmarking in *nix environments.

TODO
 - Support other operating systems than *nix.
 - Replace or augment the template directory with a setup script.
